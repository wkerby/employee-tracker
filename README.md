# Employee Tracker (CMS)

## Description

As part of this assignment, I was tasked with creating a content management system (CMS) application that reads user input and adds and updates a simple MySQL employee database. The application was designed to allow the end-user to interact with the data stored in the database.

## Usage

Below you will find a link to a video that demonstrates how the content management system works. In accordance with the user acceptance criteria, the end-user has options to view all departments,
view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

With help from the console.table package, when the end-user selects the view departments, roles, or employees option, the application returns the MySQL employee data in a nicely formatted table 


## Features

- Ability to add records of data from user input with help from the node.js inquirer package and the MySQL2 package
- Clean display of all table data with help from console.table package
- query strings that allow MySQL database to return and write data
